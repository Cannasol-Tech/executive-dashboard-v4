# Documentation Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains additional documentation for the Cannasol Technologies Executive Dashboard Flutter application. While standard Dart documentation is embedded in the code, this directory houses standalone documentation files, architectural diagrams, API references, and other documentation that doesn't belong directly in the code.

## Usage Guidelines

1. Keep documentation in this directory up-to-date with code changes
2. Use Markdown (.md) format for text documentation
3. Store diagrams in both source format and exported PNG/SVG
4. Link to specific documentation files from code comments where appropriate
5. Include version information in documentation when relevant

## Documentation Standards

- Use clear, concise language
- Include examples for complex concepts
- Add diagrams for visual clarity when appropriate
- Follow consistent formatting throughout documentation
- Update documentation as part of the development process, not as an afterthought
