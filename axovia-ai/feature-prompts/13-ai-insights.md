## Purpose
Implement the AI-Driven Insights & Anomaly Detection feature for the Cannasol Technologies Executive Dashboard. This feature will display actionable insights, significant trends, and detected anomalies generated by the backend AI agents, providing proactive decision support for executives. **Reference:** Use `axovia-ai/concept-image/analysis-concept-image.png` as a structural guideline for displaying these insights. Ensure components fit the overall simple, beautiful, modern, sleek design with the dark blue/green color scheme.

## Instructions

1.  **Insights Data Model**
    *   Define data models for various types of insights (e.g., TrendInsight, AnomalyInsight, OpportunityInsight, RiskInsight).
    *   Include fields for insight description, severity/importance, related data source (e.g., analytics, email, SEO), timestamp, and potentially actions/recommendations.
    *   Implement serialization/deserialization compatible with the backend AI agent's output format.

2.  **Insights Database/API Service**
    *   Create a service to fetch insights data from the designated Firebase collection or API endpoint populated by the backend AI.
    *   Implement real-time listeners (e.g., Firestore snapshots) to display new insights as they are generated.
    *   Handle potential pagination if the number of insights can be large.
    *   Implement error handling for data fetching.

3.  **Dedicated Insights Dashboard Section/Widget**
    *   Design a dedicated section or prominent widget(s) on the main dashboard to display the latest and most critical insights, structurally guided by `analysis-concept-image.png`.
    *   Consider grouping insights by category (e.g., Critical Alerts, Opportunities, Performance Trends).
    *   Use clear visual cues (icons, colors) to indicate insight type and severity.

4.  **Insight Card Component**
    *   Create a reusable card component to display individual insights.
    *   Clearly present the insight description, source, timestamp, and importance.
    *   (Optional) Include mini-charts or visualizations within the card if relevant to the insight.
    *   (Optional) Add action buttons if the AI provides direct recommendations (e.g., "View related data", "Dismiss", "Create task").

5.  **Insight Detail View (Optional)**
    *   Consider a detail view that users can navigate to for more information about a specific insight, potentially showing related data points or historical context.

6.  **Filtering and Prioritization**
    *   Implement mechanisms to filter insights (e.g., by data source, time range, severity).
    *   Ensure the most critical or recent insights are prioritized in the display.

7.  **User Feedback Mechanism (Optional)**
    *   Consider adding a simple feedback mechanism (e.g., thumbs up/down) on insights to help refine the backend AI's generation process.

8.  **State Management**
    *   Integrate insights data fetching and display state into the application's state management solution (e.g., Provider).

9.  **Testing**
    *   Test thoroughly with various types of sample insights data provided by the backend team.
    *   Test real-time updates and error handling scenarios.

10. **Next Steps**
    *   Mark `13-ai-insights.md` as complete upon implementation.
    *   Proceed to final testing and refinement.
