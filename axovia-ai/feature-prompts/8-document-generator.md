## Purpose
Implement the Document Viewer & Downloader tool for the Cannasol Technologies Executive Dashboard. This tool allows users to browse, view, categorize, and download proprietary company documents that have been generated by backend AI agents and stored/referenced in the cloud database.

## Instructions

1.  **Generated Document List View**
    *   Create a view to display a list of documents previously generated by the user or relevant to them.
    *   Fetch document metadata (name, template type, date generated, status, download link/identifier, category/tags) from the database (e.g., from a `generated_documents` collection populated by the backend).
    *   Implement interactive sorting (by date, name, type) and filtering/categorization options.
    *   Display document status if relevant (e.g., "Available", "Archived").
    *   Provide clear actions for each document (e.g., Preview, Download, View Details).
    *   Design a clean and intuitive layout for browsing potentially large numbers of documents (consider grid vs. list view, pagination).

2.  **Document Database Service**
    *   Create a service to fetch the list of generated documents from the relevant cloud database collection.
    *   Implement real-time listeners (e.g., Firestore snapshots) to keep the list updated as new documents become available or statuses change.
    *   Handle data transformation for display.

3.  **Document Preview Functionality**
    *   Implement functionality to display a preview of the generated document content (if feasible - e.g., fetching a preview URL, rendering a PDF/image, or showing key metadata).
    *   Ensure the preview is efficient and doesn't require downloading the full document initially.

4.  **Document Download Functionality**
    *   Implement a secure download mechanism for the completed documents.
    *   Use the download URL or identifier fetched from the database entry.
    *   Trigger the file download and handle saving on the user's device.
    *   Provide user feedback during the download process (e.g., progress indicator).

5.  **State Management & Provider**
    *   Create a state management solution (e.g., Provider) to handle the document list, filters/categories, loading states, and selected document details.

6.  **Error Handling**
    *   Implement robust error handling for database interactions (fetching list, getting download links) and the download process itself.

7. **Next Steps**
    *   Mark `8-document-generator.md` as complete upon implementation.
    *   Proceed to `9-settings-implementation.md` for Settings implementation.
