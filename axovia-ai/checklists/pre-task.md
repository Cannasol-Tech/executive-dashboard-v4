# Pre-Task Checklist

## Purpose
This checklist must be completed before beginning any implementation task for the Cannasol Technologies Executive Dashboard project to ensure proper preparation, prevent duplication, and validate task readiness.

## Task Details
- [x] **Task Name:** Document Generator Implementation
- [x] **Feature Prompt:** 7-document-generator.md
- [x] **Priority:** High
- [x] **Status:** In Progress

## Communication Protocol

If ANY item in this checklist cannot be completed or ANY confusion arises:

1. Document specific issue in `axovia-ai/notes/development-notes.md` with:
   - Detailed description of the issue
   - Related components or files
   - Potential impact on implementation
   - Suggested clarification or resolution approaches

2. Format question to human as:
    [PRE-TASK VALIDATION ISSUE]
        - Context: [Brief context about the task]
        - Issue: [Specific issue preventing checklist completion]
        - Impact: [How this affects implementation]
        - Question: [Specific, actionable question]
        - Options: [If applicable, list potential approaches]

3. Update `axovia-ai/memory/current-task.md` to reflect blocked status

4. Move on to other next tasks in implementation-plan

5. Document human response (when received) in `axovia-ai/communication/answers-to-agent.md`

## Preparation Checklist
- **Important Note:** This must be filled out accurately before EVERY SINGLE TASK from `implementation-plan.md` is filled out. 

### Memory Loading
- [x] Review axovia-ai/memory/context-memory.md to understand current project state
- [x] Review axovia-ai/memory/current-task.md to confirm this is the correct next task
- [x] Check axovia-ai/planning/implementation-plan.md to verify task is next in sequence

### Architecture Validation
- [x] Review axovia-ai/architecture/component-registry.md to understand existing components
- [x] Review axovia-ai/architecture/codebase-structure.md to understand file organization
- [x] Check for similar components that might already exist or need extension

### Duplication Prevention for Cannasol Dashboard
- [x] Search codebase for similar implementations of dashboard components/features
- [x] Verify the task hasn't been partially implemented already
- [x] Check if feature-specific directories already exist for the given task
- [x] Identify opportunities for code reuse, especially for:
  - [x] UI components (cards, dialogs, buttons)
  - [x] Firebase service methods
  - [x] Data models
  - [x] State management patterns
- [x] All potential duplication has been ruled out

### Dependency Check
- [x] Verify all required Flutter packages are available
- [x] Confirm Firebase services are configured for the feature
- [x] Check if dependent features are complete (per feature dependencies)
- [x] Verify any required Cloud Functions are implemented
- [x] Check if necessary mockups or designs are available for UI implementation

### Implementation Planning
- [x] Identify appropriate component patterns for implementation:
  - [x] For UI components: Determine widget hierarchy and layout approach
  - [x] For services: Determine service interface and implementation structure
  - [x] For state management: Select appropriate state pattern (Provider, streams, etc.)
- [x] Outline component interfaces and responsibilities
- [x] Create brief implementation approach
- [x] Identify potential challenges or uncertainties

### Technical Validation
- [x] Verify Flutter environment is properly set up
- [x] Confirm access to required Firebase project credentials
- [x] Check for any Firebase service limitations or requirements
- [x] Verify connection to required external services (if applicable)

## Feature-Specific Checks

### For Document Generator Features
- [x] Verify Firebase DB structure for document templates collection
- [x] Check existing file upload components for reuse
- [x] Confirm document generation status tracking approach
- [x] Verify Firebase Storage setup for document template storage
- [x] Check Firebase security rules for document access control
- [x] Verify dynamic form generation approach for template fields

## Communication Check
- [x] Review axovia-ai/communication/requests-to-human.md for any pending answers
- [x] Document any new questions or uncertainties before starting
- [x] Update axovia-ai/memory/current-task.md with pre-task status

## Final Verification
- [x] Confirm clear understanding of feature requirements from prompt file
- [x] Verify implementation approach aligns with project architecture
- [x] Confirm no technical blockers preventing implementation
- [x] Update memory with pre-task completion status
