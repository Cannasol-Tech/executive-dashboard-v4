## Notes

The dashboard will create a stunning visual impression while maintaining clarity and usability. Every component will be crafted with attention to detail, creating a cohesive, sophisticated experience that surprises and delights executives while providing actionable insights through beautiful visualizations.

The primary function is to serve as an elegant interface to the Firebase database and AI backend, making it easy for executives to view data, trigger AI processes, and act on results.

The Email Management feature is now fully deployed with a beautiful, functional interface that allows executives to view and manage emails with AI-generated responses.

We've successfully completed the Deployment Configuration feature, implementing a robust environment configuration system, security rules for Firestore and Storage, deployment scripts for different environments, and performed final testing to ensure everything is working as expected.

We're now focused on implementing the Document Generator feature, which will allow executives to request AI-generated documents based on templates, upload new templates, track generation status, and download completed documents. This feature is a core part of the MVP and will provide executives with a beautiful, modern interface to interact with the AI document generation system.

The Document Generator implementation is well underway with most core functionality implemented. The feature now allows executives to request AI-generated documents, track generation status, and download completed documents. We've enhanced the error handling in the DocumentGeneratorProvider class, ensuring that error messages are properly displayed to the user with a clear visual indicator. The user interface has been implemented with separate views for user-specific and shared documents, ensuring a clean and organized experience. The next major component to implement is the template upload interface, which will allow administrators to upload new document templates to the system.
