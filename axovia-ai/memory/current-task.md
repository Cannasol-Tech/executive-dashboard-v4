# Current Task: Document Generator Implementation

## Objective
Implement a beautifully modern Document Generator interface for the Cannasol Technologies Executive Dashboard, allowing executives to request AI-generated documents based on templates, upload new templates, track generation status, and download completed documents.

## Status
- [x] Pre-task checklist completed
- [x] Implementation started
- [x] Core UI components implemented
- [x] Core services implemented
- [x] Basic document flow (request â†’ status â†’ download) implemented
- [ ] Template upload interface implemented
- [ ] Final visual polish added
- [ ] Task completion checklist finalized

## Current Focus
We've made significant progress on the Document Generator feature. The core functionality for requesting documents, viewing document status, and downloading completed documents is fully implemented. We've created a provider for state management, UI components for displaying documents, and services for interacting with Firebase. Our next focus will be implementing the template upload interface, enhancing the visual styling, and adding smooth animations for a more premium user experience.

## Task Priority
High - This is a core feature of the MVP that will allow executives to interact with the AI document generation system through an elegant interface.

### Implementation Approach
We've successfully created a beautiful, modern document generation interface with elegant animations and a clean design that fits the dashboard's aesthetic. The interface includes a sleek document request form that dynamically updates based on template selection, a status tracker showing document generation progress in real-time, a document browser with separate views for user-specific and shared documents, and secure download functionality with visual feedback.

### Current Progress
We've fully implemented the DocumentGeneratorProvider which handles the state management for the feature. The provider connects to Firebase services, manages document templates, user requests, and generated documents. It provides methods for selecting templates, submitting document requests, and retrieving document data.

Our next focus will be implementing the template upload interface, which is the last major component of the Document Generator feature. This will involve creating a file upload widget with drag-and-drop support, implementing secure Firebase Storage upload functionality, adding a metadata form for template categorization, and creating template preview functionality.

## Database Structure
The feature interacts with the following Firebase collections:
- `document-templates`: Stores document templates and their metadata
- `document-request`: Contains requests to the document generator
- `generated-documents/user`: Holds user-specific generated documents
- `generated-documents/shared`: Contains shared generated documents
- `generator-status`: Tracks the status of document generation (waiting, processing, generated)

## Dependencies
- Authentication implementation is complete
- Dashboard layout framework is in place
- Firebase project is properly set up
- Deployment configuration is complete

## Next Steps
1. Implement template upload interface:
   - Create file upload widget with drag-and-drop support
   - Implement secure Firebase Storage upload functionality
   - Add template metadata form for categorization
   - Create template preview functionality
2. Enhance the DocumentGeneratorProvider:
   - Add methods for uploading templates
   - Implement template preview functionality
   - Add support for template deletion and updates
3. Polish the UI:
   - Add animations and transitions for smoother user experience
   - Enhance visual styling for consistent dashboard aesthetic
   - Improve error handling and loading states
   - Add empty state displays for no documents/templates
4. Complete testing:
   - Test document request flow end-to-end
   - Verify template upload and management
   - Test document sharing functionality
   - Ensure all error states are handled gracefully
