# Current Task: Chatbot Interface Implementation

## Objective
Implement a beautifully modern Chatbot Interface for the Cannasol Technologies Executive Dashboard, allowing executives to interact with an AI assistant through natural language conversation, receive responses, and execute actions through the chat interface.

## Status
- [x] Pre-task checklist completed
- [ ] Implementation started
- [ ] Core UI components implemented
- [ ] Core services implemented
- [ ] Basic chat flow (message → response → display) implemented
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Message display enhancements added
- [ ] Visual polish added
- [ ] Tests created for models and services
- [ ] Task completion checklist finalized

## Implementation Plan
We'll implement the Chatbot Interface with the following approach:

### Components to Implement
1. [ ] Chat Interface Layout
   - [ ] Design beautiful modern UI with message bubbles and gradients
   - [ ] Implement message input field with send button
   - [ ] Create scrollable message history display
   - [ ] Add typing indicator for AI responses
   - [ ] Implement elegant animations for message transitions
2. [ ] Chat Service
   - [ ] Create ChatService with Firebase integration
   - [ ] Implement message sending functionality
   - [ ] Create response handling and parsing
   - [ ] Add real-time update listeners
   - [ ] Implement error handling and retry logic
3. [ ] Message Display Components
   - [ ] Create UserMessageWidget for user messages
   - [ ] Implement AIMessageWidget for AI responses
   - [ ] Add SystemMessageWidget for system notifications
   - [ ] Create timestamp and read receipt indicators
   - [ ] Implement message threading (if applicable)
4. [ ] State Management
   - [ ] Create ChatProvider for overall chat state
   - [ ] Implement conversation history management
   - [ ] Add loading state handling
   - [ ] Create error handling and feedback

## Database Structure
The feature will interact with the following Firebase collections:
- `chat-conversations`: Stores conversation metadata and participants
- `chat-messages`: Contains individual messages within conversations
- `chat-actions`: Tracks actions suggested or executed through chat

## Implementation Approach
We'll create a beautiful, modern chat interface with elegant animations and a clean design that fits the dashboard's aesthetic. The interface will include a sleek message input area, a scrollable message history with distinct styling for user and AI messages, typing indicators, and visual feedback for message status.

Our implementation will follow the same clean architecture approach used throughout the project:
1. **Models**: Clear data classes for messages, conversations, and actions
2. **Services**: Firebase integration with proper error handling and security
3. **Providers**: State management with the Provider pattern
4. **UI**: Elegant, responsive interface with consistent design system integration
